# Project Seminar Programming - Fitness Tracker

Repository for the project seminar in programming for the winter semester 25/26.

## Usage

The repository includes Dockerfiles for both backend and frontend plus a `docker-compose.yml` for running them together.

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The backend is then available at `http://localhost:8080` and the frontend at `http://localhost:4200`. To stop the stack and remove the containers, run:

```bash
docker compose down
```
